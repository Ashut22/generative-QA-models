Generative QA Model for Medical Transcription Analysis
This project focuses on building Generative Question Answering (QA) Models to extract specific patient details from medical transcriptions with high accuracy and exact match rates. It provides a structured learning path that gradually introduces the fundamentals of Generative AI and progresses towards hands-on implementation with real-world medical datasets.

Features
Automated Information Extraction: Extract patient details like age, complaints, gender, reasons for consultation, and symptoms from medical transcriptions.
High-Accuracy Models: Utilizes pretrained models like BioBERT and BERT-Large fine-tuned on medical QA datasets.
F1 Score Evaluation: Ensures performance assessment by calculating field-specific and average F1 scores for exact match accuracy.
Real-World Dataset: Works with datasets containing detailed medical transcription data for practical learning.
Key Objectives
